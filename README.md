# TODO

- [ ] Images are not cleared from memory so endless scrolling results in infinite memory expansion
- [ ] Snapshot testing should run on multiple devices and actually compare screenshots
- [ ] Sometimes runs into 403 error which seems to be a rate limit by the backend
- [ ] ViewModel Unit Tests
